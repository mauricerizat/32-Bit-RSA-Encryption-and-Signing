# 64-Bit-RSA-Encryption-and-Signing
A console-based C++ program that performs 64-Bit RSA encryption, decryption, signature and verification. Purely for self-learning purpose.

## IMPORTANT 

THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN C++ (C++11 recommended)

THIS README DEMONSTRATES THE EXECUTION OF THIS PROGRAM ON A LINUX TERMINAL WITH A C++ COMPILER

## FILE IO 

This program only accepts files containging exclusively integer numbers. As such, it can only perform operations on intergers. I did not include the code required to encode strings into integers to work with this program. 

Please place all program associated files to be processed in the "data" folder.

Make sure to include the extention of the file if required.

The output file will also be stored in the "data" folder.

This has been done to minimize clutter.

## COMPILATION 

Enter the following command into the terminal to compile the program along with all dependencies:

**make**

## EXECUTION 

Enter the following command into the terminal to run the program:

**./RSA.out**

## CLEAN 

Enter the following command into the terminal to remove all objects and .out files associated with the program:

**make clean**
